        Classic Vegetable Couscous Recipe:
      </p>
      <p>
        Ingredients:
      </p>
      <p>
        1 1/2 cups couscous
2 cups vegetable broth
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
Salt and pepper to taste
2 carrots, peeled and sliced
2 zucchinis, sliced
1 bell pepper, diced
1 cup canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1 cup diced tomatoes (fresh or canned)
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro or parsley, for garnish
Lemon wedges, for serving
      </p>
      <p>
        Instructions:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Stir in the ground cumin, ground coriander, ground cinnamon, ground turmeric, ground ginger, salt, and pepper. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the spices are fragrant.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Add the sliced carrots, zucchinis, diced bell pepper, chickpeas, and diced tomatoes to the pot. Stir well to combine.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Pour in the vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a boil.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. While the vegetables are simmering, prepare the couscous according to the package instructions. Typically, you would bring the vegetable broth to a boil, add the couscous, cover, and let it sit off the heat for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. Once the vegetables are tender, taste the stew and adjust seasoning if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        9. To serve, fluff the couscous with a fork and divide it among serving plates. Ladle the vegetable stew over the couscous.
      </p>
      <p>
        10. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro or parsley and serve with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the couscous.
